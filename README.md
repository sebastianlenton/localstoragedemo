This demo accompanies my blog post at (http://www.sebastianlenton.com/2015/07/local-storage-multi-window-javascript-apps "Fun With Local Storage: Multi-Window JavaScript Apps & Canvas Streaming"). It demonstrates using local storage to create a multi-window web application, plus also using it to stream a canvas from one window to another in realtime.
